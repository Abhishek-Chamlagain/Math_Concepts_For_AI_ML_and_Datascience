# Probability 
"""It is a measure of likelihood or chances that an event will occur
Probability lies between 0 and 1, so maximum wil be one (Always True), 
and minimum wll be zero(Always False)"""

# Example
""" P(sun rises from east) = always True = 1
    P(sun rises from west) = always False = 0"""

# Sample Space
"""Set of all possible outputs, Example of dice = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
case = odd number = {1, 3, 5}... This is called event
Event is a subset of sample space"""

"""Set
In probability, a set is a collection of elements/outcomes.
The sample space itself is a set.
Events are sets too (subsets of the sample space)."""

"""Union ( U )
Intersection ( ∩ )
Difference ( - )
Complement ( A' )
Mutually Exclusive (Disjoint) Sets
"""

"""Fair Event
A fair event occurs in a random experiment where all possible outcomes are equally likely.
In other words, no outcome is favored over another.
If all outcomes in the sample space have the same probability, the experiment is fair."""

# Conditional Probability
"""and = Both condition should be true
or = from both one condition should be true

p(A|B)= p(AnB)/p(b)
Here | -> pipe"""

# MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS
"""The occurance of one event excludes the occurance of another, then the events are 
mutually exclusive events  p(AnB)=∅"""

#Independent Events
"""If the occurance of one event doesnt alter the chances of occurance of other event"""
